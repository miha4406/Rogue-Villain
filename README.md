Known issues:
    synch problem if Host is not Player1 (working on it)
    some options screen is needed
    new message system is needed	
    no models for gold/item hexes
    every char needs at least animations for mining (Explorer has unique) and for skill usage (pitate has 2)
    endgame table added but not sorted   (fix later)
    Pirate's turn was increased to 2 for testing purposes
    Phantom spends 2 turns to pick up item (was it planned?)
